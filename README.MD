## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/ozerbaykal/Movie-App.git
   cd Movie-App
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install

```

3. Create a .env file:
   You will need to create a .env file in the root directory of the project to securely store your API key and base URLs.

Example .env file:

```
VITE_BASE_URL="https://api.themoviedb.org/3"
VITE_AUTHORIZATION_KEY="Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
VITE_BASE_IMG_URL="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original"

```

- Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual TMDb API key. If you don't have an API key, you can get one by registering at [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

4. Run the development server:

```
npm run dev

```
